##The Pan-African Flat Icon Set.

*All icons are in SVG format.*




##Background

Iweconic is an attempt to express a small part of the beauty and diversity of Africa through symbology. We use flat design because it naturally fits with vibrant colors, elegant shapes and simple patterns: hallmarks of traditional African art and design. 

We encourage you to make use of this free and open-source icon set for your start-up or website. This is a work in progress with more icons appearing weekly. 

##Conitrbute

We need contributers! We are currently in the process of building a live platform where designers will be able to submit their own icons automatically. Until then, please email your icons to hello@iweconic.com . We would love to meet you! Alternatively, send us a pull request.
